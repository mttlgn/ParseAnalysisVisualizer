Goals:

Create a simple tool to allow for analysis of the data in the csv files.
This analysis should focus on the following:

- The percentage share each class and spec has in each raid.
- Differences between these percentages between raids.
- Trends in the data between raids compared to each other.

This analysis should be presented via charts, graphs, and tables using modern visualization tools and design languages.

Timeline: Within the next hour. Extremely simple.
